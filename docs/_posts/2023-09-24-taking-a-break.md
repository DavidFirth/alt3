After 6 years of making and updating the _alt-3_ tables, I am taking a break from it in order to focus on other projects.  There will be no _alt-3_ tables in the next few months, and possibly none in the whole of the 2023--24 season. 

My intention is to re-start things in the early weeks of the 2024--25 season, at the latest.
