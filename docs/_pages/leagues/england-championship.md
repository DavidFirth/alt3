The table below is as at the end of the 2020--2021 season. The _alt-3_ table for the new season will appear here in early November.  (Sorry for the delay, due to some local difficulties.)

<!-- This page is normally updated 2 hours after each scheduled match kickoff time, unless a match is still in play. -->
