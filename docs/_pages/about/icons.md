Icons are available for use on all the major touch-screen platforms.

<img width="100%" src = "/assets/images/homescreen-icons-link.png">

To put an **alt-3** icon on your home screen, from some of the most common web browsers:

- **Firefox:** From the Firefox menu, pick **Page > Add to Home Screen**

- **Chrome:** From the Chrome menu, pick **Add to Home screen**

- **Opera:** From the Opera menu, pick **Home screen**

- **Safari:** Hit the *share* button in Safari (the little square with an up-arrow), and then pick **Add to Home Screen**.

You can of course add *multiple* home-screen icons if you want, linked to different pages of *alt3.uk*.

## Naming your icon(s)

Most web browsers seem to allow you to specify the label that will appear beneath your icon on your home screen.  (For example, "alt-3" as above, or perhaps "Premier League", or some other label that you choose to relate to the page that's linked with the icon.)

**Firefox** on some platforms does not make it so easy. The trick seems to be to make a
Firefox *bookmark* for the page you want linked, first.  Then name the bookmark.  Then add to the home screen.
