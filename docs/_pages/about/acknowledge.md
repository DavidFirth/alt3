### Funding

Most of *alt-3* is the work of many evenings and weekends, 
not really funded by anyone! 

But the project grew tangentially out of two other, 
more substantial programmes of work, 
carried out at the University of Warwick some years ago. Two
different UK research-funding bodies must be acknowledged for
their support through research grants:

- The *Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council* (EPSRC) 
funded 'Generalized Nonlinear Models: Theory, Computation and
Extensions' (2009--2012).  Among the outputs of that project was
the [BradleyTerry2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BradleyTerry2)
package for *R* --- work on which led us to develop the *alt-3* method.

- The *Economic and Social Research Council* (ESRC) funded 
'Models, Measurement and Inference in Social Research' (2003--2006).
The [gnm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gnm) package for R, 
which is used extensively in *alt-3*, was one of the main outputs
of that project.

The sustained and ongoing academic support of the *University of Warwick* itself,
through its excellent research facilities, is also gratefully acknowledged.

### Data sources

There are two sources of football results data used in *alt-3*.  They are:

- for the 'live' feed of results during the current season, 
[football-data.org](http://football-data.org);

- for historical data, on many previous seasons, 
[football-data.co.uk](http://football-data.co.uk)

The creators and maintainers of those data sources deserve great kudos for
the wonderful work they have done to make such data freely available to all.

### Open-source statistical software

All of the data wrangling and statistical analysis for *alt-3* is done in the
open-source [R](http://R-project.org) software.  The creators and maintainers of
*R*, and of the various contributed *R* packages that are used in the *alt-3* 
code, are due enormous thanks for their generous work in creating a brilliant
environment for statistical computing and publication.

### Internet hosting and other open-source software

The *alt-3* website is hosted on [Github](https://github.com), and is built
using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a variant of the 
[Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.
The developers of all of these deserve great thanks for their generous
work.

### Some individual acknowledgements

The details of the *alt-3* method and its implementation have been informed by
some excellent Masters-level 
projects undertaken by students at the University of Warwick,
notably the project dissertations of Seulki Chung (2016) and 
Jonathan Kent (2017).

Thanks go also to Fred Firth, for critical reading of the early draft 
content of this website --- and especially to the rest of his family, for their
patience and understanding while 'the geek' (Fred's dad) was busy playing
with all this!
