## Key:

The league-table **rankings** are shown in the centre of the table, with the **_alt-3_ league position in bold** to the right, and the more standard league-table position (based on points already in the bag, with goal-difference to resolve ties where needed) shown in the grey section of the table, to the left.

In the central dark-blue vertical band are (typically) up- or down-arrows to indicate where teams are higher or lower in the *alt-3* table than in the standard table. A solid arrow <img src="/assets/images/up2.svg" width="15"> or <img src="/assets/images/down2.svg" width="15"> indicates a difference of 3 or more league places.

The other numbers shown in the table are:

<ul>
	<li>The usual league-table summaries:
	        <ul>
			<li><b>Pld:</b> matches played to date</li>
        		<li><b>GD:</b> goal difference</li>
        		<li><b>Pts:</b> league points accumulated to date</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
    	<li>The <b><i>alt-3</i></b> league table:
        <ul>
		<li><b>ePld:</b> the <i>alt-3</i> measure of each team's
		<b><i>effective number of matches played</i></b> to date.
		<ul><li>Where <b>ePld</b> is less than the
		actual number <b>Pld</b> of matches played,
		the team has
		played tougher opposition than average and/or has played fewer
		matches at home than away; and vice-versa where <b>ePld</b>
		exceeds <b>Pld</b>.</li>
		<li>Where the difference between <b>Pld</b> and <b>ePld</b>
		is a whole match or more,
		the team's numbers in the <i>alt-3</i> table are colour-highlighted
		(in
		<span style="background-color:#ddffdd;">light green</span>
		where <i>ePld</i> is less than <i>Pld</i>,
		and <span style="background-color:#ffdddd;">light red</span>
		where the reverse is true).</li>
		<li>Where schedule-strength imbalance is so strong that
		<b>Pld</b> and <b>ePld</b> differ by more than 2.0, the
		entry in the <b>ePld</b> column is shown in <b>bold type</b> </li>
		</ul></li>
        	<li><b>Rate:</b> the <b><i>league points per effective
		match played</i></b>, i.e., 
		<center>   <b>  Rate = Pts &#247; ePld </b>. </center>
		</li>
	</ul>
	The <i>alt-3</i> league table is sorted according to the current
		values of <b>Rate</b>.
	</li>
</ul>
